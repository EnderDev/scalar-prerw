Over the course of April, we have been hard at work at making Dot Browser even better, and weâ€™re excited to show you what weâ€™ve been working on!

# New Dot HQ Branding

```tsx
import React from "react";

class Application extends React.Component {
    public constructor() {

    }

    public render() {
        const myvar: string = "hello";
        const num: number = 1;
        const mybool: boolean = true;

        return (
            <h1>Hello World ðŸ‘‹</h1>
        )
    }
}
```

# New Website

Weâ€™ve been experimenting and building a new website to showcase Dot Browser. Keep in mind that the site is still a work-in-progress, so not everything is working as expected.

# Dot Shield Updates

Also this month, we integrated our ad blocker (known as Dot Shield) into the browser. Now, you donâ€™t even have to do anything to start blocking ads, other than download Dot!

# Did someone mention cookies?

We have made some needed changes to the privacy side of Dot Browser this month, including: finally blocking third-party cookies and disabling the captive portal pings.

# Dot Builds

We are very excited to announce that Dot Browser now is available in both [AppImage](https://github.com/dothq/browser-desktop/releases/latest/download/Dot_Browser-x86-64.AppImage) and [Flatpak](https://github.com/dothq/browser-desktop/releases/latest/download/dot-nightly.flatpak) format, as well as officially available on the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/dot-bin/), hopefully opening up the browser to even more users than before!

# Dot ID Improvements

Weâ€™ve been hard at work getting Dot IDâ€™s ready for use. Our accounts hub is getting even closer to being complete. Unfortunately, we are unable to reveal much information about this just yet, but we are planning on getting Dot ID into a beta stage very soon.

# Wrap Up

Thank you for reading!

Stay tuned for our May 2021 Development Report, coming out (you guessed it), 1st June 2021!
